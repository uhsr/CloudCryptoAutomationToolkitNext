# CloudCryptoAutomationToolkitNext

## Description

This repository houses a Rust-based cryptographic library implementing novel zero-knowledge proof constructions optimized for resource-constrained embedded systems, leveraging SIMD instructions for accelerated elliptic curve operations.

## Features

- Integrate with AWS KMS and Azure Key Vault for secure key management and rotation.
- Automate the deployment and configuration of HashiCorp Vault for secrets management across cloud environments.
- Implement automated compliance checks against CIS benchmarks for cloud infrastructure security.
- Generate customizable Terraform templates for infrastructure-as-code deployments of crypto-related services.
- Orchestrate automated vulnerability scanning and remediation workflows using tools like Nessus and Qualys.
- Enable role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions for managing crypto assets and infrastructure.
- Provide a REST API for programmatic access to automation features and monitoring data.
- Support multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative and privileged access to the toolkit.
